# Train_Activity_Basic

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:


* When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
* Train Name
* Destination 
* First Train Time -- in military time
* Frequency -- in minutes
* Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
* Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
* Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

Starting arrival time is at 5:00 am, the train arrives every 10 minuts and the current time is 3:22 so the train will arrive at 3:30 hence 8 min away.

Starting arrival time is 2:00(14:00) the current time is 3:25(15:25), the train arrives every 10 min so the train will arrive at 3:30 hence 5 min away.
